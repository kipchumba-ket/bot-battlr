# Bot Battlr

## Project Goals
Implement a mini web app to practice components, props, state, events, and data fetching in react
# RUNNING THE APPLICATION

 You can access the web app directly by clicking <a href = "https://bot-battlr-rosy.vercel.app/">here</a>.

## Introduction
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

### Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:
See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
